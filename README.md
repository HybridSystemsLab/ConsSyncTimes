I. Synopsis
------------
This program simulates a consensus algorithm of five agents connected via a directed
strongly connected with an adjacency matrix given by 
            
	G = [0 1 1 0 1; 1 0 1 0 0; 1 0 0 1 0; 0 0 1 0 1; 1 0 1 1 0];  
    
where the agents are only able to communicate at stocastically determined isolated events.
